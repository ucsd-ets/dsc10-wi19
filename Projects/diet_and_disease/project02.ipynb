    "**Deadline.** This project is due at 11:59pm on Sunday, 3/17. It's **much** better to be early than late, so start working now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Free Response Questions**: The free response questions and plots for the project are **optional** and ungraded, meaning you do **not** need to submit a PDF of this notebook to Gradescope. These questions tend to be open-ended. However, these questions will be very good practice for the free-response exam questions, so do give them a good effort. Solutions will be posted after the project late submission deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partners.** You may work with one other partner. Your partner must be enrolled in the same lab as you are. Only one of you is required to submit the project. On [okpy.org](http://okpy.org), the person who submits should also designate their partner so that both of you receive credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules.** Don't share your code with anybody but your partner. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for exams (and life). If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support.** You are not alone! Come to office hours, post on Piazza, and talk to your classmates. If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, make a private Piazza post and the staff will respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tests.** Passing the tests for a question **does not** mean that you answered the question correctly. Tests usually only check that your table has the correct column labels. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. \n",

The main difference between the Minnesota Coronary Experiment and the rest of the National Diet-Heart Study was the setting.

We've recreated Dr. Frantz's data, run our own experiments, and examined important external factors. It's now time to reflect on what we've discovered."
